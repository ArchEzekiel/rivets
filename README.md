# Rivets ðŸ”©

Welcome to the Rivets, a Factorio modding written in Rust! Rivets injects code into the Factorio binary via DLL injection, providing a powerful toolset for modding and enhancing the game.

## Features

- **Procedural Macros**: Utilize idiomatic proc macros to overwrite or detour compiled Factorio functions.

Here is an example of how to detour the `main` function:
```rust
#[detour(main)]
fn main(argc: c_int, argv: *const c_char, envp: *const c_char) {
    info!("Detoured into main! ðŸ¦€ðŸ”©");
}
```
This will intercept the `main` function call and execute your custom logic, allowing you to modify the behavior of the game.

- **Seamless interop with Factorio Lua**: Mods written with Rivets can easily subscribe to lua events, and call `remote` API's to share data with Factorio mods written in Lua.

```rust
#[on_event(defines::events::on_player_died)]
fn on_player_died(player_index: u32, cause: LuaEntity) {
    let player: LuaPlayer = game.get_player(player_index);
    player.print("You just lost the game ðŸ’€");
}
```
